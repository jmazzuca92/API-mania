Greetings!

The working code on this repository can be located on the the following path: Instructions>Starter_Code>financial-planner.ipynb

The purpose of the code is create a financial planner application for retail clients to assess if their savings portfolio has generated a sufficient emergency fund to live life comfortably. Each client's portfolio for this assessment considers their cryptocurrency, equities, and bond assets. 

It is assumed that the average monthly income is $12,000.

For a client to be considered to have a suffient emergency fund accumulated, the combined value of their assest considered must be greater than or equal to three times their monthly income.

The latter portion of the code is to assist clients plan for their retirement. First, we view a savings plan over a thirty year period with a balanced portfolio. For simplicity, a balanced portfolio is comprised of 40 percent investment in bonds and 60 percent investment in equities. Other scenarios underconsideration are shorter time horizons, increased risk tolerance, and higher amount of initial investment.
